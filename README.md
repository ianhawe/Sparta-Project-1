Challenges

Some of the more basic elements of this project became very time draining. Such as using 'e' in a function to declare the function as an event function. Another example of this is not having return values in functions, that I needed to use in order to perform Pythagorean theorem on.

Other then that, A little bit of collision detection seemed to mess me up for time.
