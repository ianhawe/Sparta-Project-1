### Challenges (you can include images and code block here)
1. Some of the more basic elements of this project became very time draining. Such as using 'e' in a function to declare the function as an event function. This led to player movement issues.
2. Collision detection - This was what my main problem was, this was both for player, and balls which bounce around. This also included the finish line.

### Learning points
1. A better nderstanding of JavaScript
2. Understanding of collision between objects 
3. A Better understanding of event listeners in JavaScript
